# Introduction

 Our vision in creating SE Hub wasn't to re-invent the wheel, but rather unify all the resources needed to solve these problems under one roof - SE Hub. Bringing to the table features like:
- Lecturer exercise tracking of individual tasks.
- Personal team messages.
- Communications made easy and accessible for both lecturers and students.
- Lecturer and teacher grading, follow up scores and etc.
- Peer assessment and activity on git-hub.
- Scheduling and event logs.
